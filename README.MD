So I managed to do it!

I struggled a lot at the start and had to go back to previous code i have written to remember a few things.
However im quite happy with how this came out. It's not perfect by any means but its proved to me that I can make
something without following a video lecture.

I will be remaking something with CSS before moving onto the JAVA section I think. But let me know what you think.

Im still getting used to using the GIT termial but im getting there. I write really long messages and then the commit 
fails because I input the wrong things so then i end up not writing a proper message again. Again this is just a minor
learning curve im quite happy with my understanding of Git & GitHub at the moment.
